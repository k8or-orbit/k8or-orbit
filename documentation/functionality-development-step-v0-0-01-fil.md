# Functionality Development Steps

## Requirements Gathering and Design:
1. Identify the necessary frontend and backend microservices, along with required backend resources, for the given functionality.
2. Develop high-level diagrams, using proper naming and numbering conventions, illustrating component communication for each functionality (upload, search, transfer, and deploy).
3. For each functionality, meticulously document all inter-communication processes between components. This documentation must specify endpoints, protocols (HTTPS, HTTP), request types (GET, POST), synchronicity (synchronous, asynchronous), and request/response payloads for all interactions. Ensure consistent naming and numbering conventions are applied to these inter-communication processes. All interactions must include both a request and a response.
4. Identify the databases, tables, schemas, and all other relevant attributes for DynamoDB and MySQL, as well as S3 bucket names and folder structures.
5. Update all relevant diagrams to reflect the database table names and attributes. Review and update (or create) the inter-communication process documentation, ensuring proper naming and numbering conventions are maintained.

## Infrastructure Provisioning:

1. Provision, create, and configure the necessary EC2 instances.
2. Provision, create, and configure the required backend resources, including DynamoDB tables, a MySQL database, and S3 buckets.

## Frontend Development:

1. Identify all necessary functions within the given frontend microservice.
2. Develop the required code for each function, utilizing a chatbot for assistance.
3. Document and store all generated functions in a GitHub repository, adhering to proper naming and numbering conventions.
4. Create a Jira ticket for the microservice development and assign it to a developer.
5. Developers must always push code to a ticket branch, never directly to the master branch.
6. Identify and resolve any issues in the process or code, adjusting and updating the code as needed.
7. Develop the complete frontend microservice.
8. Install the required frontend-related packages on the designated EC2 instance.
9. Deploy the frontend microservice to the EC2 instance.
10. Thoroughly test the frontend microservice.

## Backend Development:

1. Identify all necessary functions within the given backend microservice(s).
2. Develop the required code for each function, utilizing a chatbot for assistance.
3. Document and store all generated functions in a GitHub repository, adhering to proper naming and numbering conventions.
4. Create a Jira ticket for the microservice development and assign it to a developer.
5. Developers must always push code to a ticket branch, never directly to the master branch.
6. Identify and resolve any issues in the process or code, adjusting and updating the code as needed.
7. Develop the complete backend microservice(s).
8. Install the required backend-related packages on the designated EC2 instance(s).
9. Deploy the backend microservice(s) to the EC2 instance(s).
10. Thoroughly test the backend microservice(s).

## Integration and Testing:

1. Integrate the frontend and backend microservices and conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing.
